# 📚 Self-Hosting Guide
For detailed instructions on how to run your own instance of the bot, please refer to the [SELFHOST.md](SELFHOST.md) file.

## Note:

There is a publicly available instance of the bot that I am currently using myself:

https://t.me/LunchMoneyAppBot

However, please consider the following before using it:
- I run this instance without any uptime or security guarantees.
- I cannot guarantee the safety of your data.
- Use this instance at your own risk.

If you decide to use it, please be aware that while I promise not to look at or use your token, I cannot provide any assurances beyond my word.

The bot is designed to support multiple users, meaning the same bot can track transactions for different accounts, such as mine and my wife's, in their respective Telegram accounts.
